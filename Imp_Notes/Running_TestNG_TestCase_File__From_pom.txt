Q-How to configure testNg file in pom.xml
A-just add maven surefire plugin and give location of all your testNG testcase XML file there.

Q-How to run them 
A-run pom.xml via maven test command. All you xml testcases get executed, report (extent and emailable) gets generated.

Q-What is the benefit of this
A-In your project, you can have multiple testsuite based on your module like LoginModule.xml, RegistrationModule.xml and ProductCategory.xml.To run them 
all in one shot, there is no other way. We need to configure them in "pom.xml" file. Everything will get executed one by one

Q-Is there any way to supply test data to all your testscripts via "pom.xml"?
A- use following tag in your plugin
					<systemPropertyVariables>
						<property>
							<name>username</name>
							<value>${DuserName}</value>
						</property>
						<property>
							<name>password</name>
							<value>${Dpassword}</value>
						</property>
						<property>
							<name>url</name>
							<value>${Durl}</value>
						</property>
					
Now we are able to supply username and password to any testscipts. To read them from pom.xml, you need to make some chamges
in PropertyReader class and changing their interface accordingly. Access them using System.getProperty(key)

To test them, run with configuration, provide their value at their runtime via the vm arguments there by "-Durl=". You can do this for pom.xml or testNG.xml or runnig testscipt file.you just
need to provide the value to these properties in VM arguments otherwise they will pick the default one, provided in config.text
